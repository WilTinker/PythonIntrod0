    "### Functions? Functions!\n",
    "\n",
    "What are functions? Well, you already used functions: *print()* and *input()*\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a group of statements that perfoms a *specific task*. Functions accept data, process it, and (may) return a result. \n",
    "#### Benefits of using functions are:\n",
    "##### - Organization\n",
    "A function is like a mini-program. Function allows us to divide a complicated program into a smaller, more manageable blocks. When defining a function, you can concentrate on the functionality of a function rather than on the entire complexity of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - Reusability\n",
    "Once a function is defined, it can be used **without** writing the same code again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - Testing\n",
    "Because a function reduces a redundancy, there is less code to test in the first place. Also, because functions are self-contained, once a function has been tested to ensure it works, you don't need to test it again unless you modified it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - Extensibility\n",
    "When you need to extend functionalities, you could modify in one place (in a function) and have that change take effect every time the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - Abstraction\n",
    "You don't need to know ***how a function works***. You just need to know the name, arguements, and output(functionality) of a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "**def** *function_name* **(** *arguement1, arguement2, ...* **):**\n",
    "\n",
    "        statement1\n",
    "        statement2\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        statementn\n",
    "\n",
    "where you decide on what the function's name is and decide what it will do using statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the parenthsis, you put the amount of arguments you have seperated each by commas.\n",
    "After the colon, all the lines that are **indented *four spaces*** will be a part of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **def** is how you define a function but it cannot be used until you call it.\n",
    "You can *call* it only after you have *defined* it.\n",
